// Hello! This is my first javascript file! I am learning how to use javascript to make websites interactive! Speaking of javascript, this is a comment! You can write comments like this to explain your code! This is also the only type of code to be ignored by the javascript interpreter! Have fun!


alert("Hello, reader! I am an alert from the javascript file! Welcome to my first website with Javascript!");
console.log("Hello, reader! I am a console log from the javascript file!");
/*You can also use console.log to log math!
So if you created 2 variables, like this:*/
// let number1 = 5;
// let number2 = 10;
// You can add them together like this:
// (temporarily disabled)console.log(`The sum of ${number1} (number1 variable) and ${number2} (number2 variable) is:`);
//console.log(number1 + number2); 
// This will log 15 to the console!

// However, if you try to log a variable that doesn't exist, like this:
// console.log(nonExistentVariable); // This would log an error to the console! (sorry, had to disable it to prevent errors, which halts all JavaScript execution!)


/* This is a multi-line comment in javascript!
You can write comments like this to explain your code!
This is useful for when you come back to your code later and forget what it does!

// Let's create a variable!
let variable1 = 3;

// Let's create more variables!

// You can also use comments to disable code! This is useful for testing and debugging! Like this:
// alert("This alert is disabled! You can enable it by removing the // at the start of the line!");

// Ok, let's get back to the code!
// Let's make some interactive buttons!
buttonlonely = document.getElementById("buttonlonley")


buttonlonely.onclick = function() {
    alert("*GASP* YOU CLICKED ME!!! THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!");

// I will add more Javascript code Soon! I am still learning!
